Oyster Disease Report Sheet Flowchart - Data Extraction Written Tutorial

1. Locate papers online

* Use key phrases such as “Oyster”, “Eastern Oyster”, “Disease”, “prevalence”, “Dermo”, “MSX”. 
* Main focus: Any studies in the past 70 years, looking at presence/prevalence of main oyster diseases & parasites. 
* Google Scholar - Eric said pages 1-3 have been completely sourced, so begin on page 4, cross-checking with previously sourced articles on the Report sheet.

Where to find published articles? 
* Northeastern Library → OneSearch → Filter by Peer-Reviewed Journals https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/primo-explore/search?vid=NU
* Web of Science NU
* Unpublished information by state agencies 


2. OysterDiseaseReport Tab

* Code new papers by coloring them yellow in the sheet - this means that Thais/Katie has not yet reviewed it. 
* Create a PubCode, copy/paste title & DOI into sheet
* Read abstract, introduction, results. If anything is unclear, read the methods section. Can message Eric and/or Thais for clarification(s). 
* Write a summary and add location data (including lat/long if given) to the tab.
*Add comments/questions to the furthest right column in the entry.


3. Map Tab

* Enter PubCode and Person1 Name (add my name into data validation). 
* Enter study site name, state, and lat/long data.
* Select TRUE/FALSE for presence of disease (Dermo and/or MSX) in the data validation menu for each individual study site. 


4. Data Collection - also see linked data extraction tutorial video

* Take a screenshot of the graph you’re extracting data from and save it into a folder specifically for each publication, named with the PubCode. Name the image with the figure name from the article. 
* Use a digitizer tool (Data Thief or Web Plot Digitizer) to load the screenshot.
* Create a 2D x-y plot for manual data extraction. Pick two points along each axis, press complete, and check.
* Add dots following the entire length of the trend line, or one dot at the top of each bar in a bar graph/histogram. To err on the side of caution, adding more dots creates a more robust dataset. 
* Click view data to give a snapshot of a .CSV file. 
* Remove the slash (/) in any date data by formatting it before exporting. 
* Download the .CSV file and open it to view the data.
* Paste the data into the appropriate category of the Data_Summary3 spreadsheet (mean salinity, mean temperature, prevalence %, prevalence proportion)
* Select appropriate disease at the right end of the row in the data validation menu.


5. Individual Data Tab (Madeline / Final = Data_Summary3)

Create a new tab in the spreadsheet: Data_summary tab is Luke’s data; Data_summary2 is Eric’s raw extracted data.

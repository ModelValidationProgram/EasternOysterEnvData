### Prevalence Data
Currently waiting on receipt of Ford 1996 to extract superimposed MSX prevalence values. 

### Cumulative Mortality
Avoid collecting cumulative mortality data - we need to be able to combine mortality with salinity and temperature on a more precise timescale.

### Extraneous Annual and 5-year Averaged Salinity Data
For the following sites: Atlantic City, NJ; Newport, RI; Bridgeport, CT; Woods Hole, MA. Can be collected (if we are interested in these averaged values?) when disease data is extracted for the same sites.

### Extraneous Salinity Data
Unextracted salinity data for low- and high- salinity sites in the Chesapeake Bay from 1995 - 2001. (Piankatank River and Lynnhaven Bay).

Discussed data extraction papers (Andrews 1964, Andrews 1984, Ford 1987)
Data extracted from these three papers will be the first data entered into a new data frame created by Madeline.


HS Interns will be given figures from the three papers over the next weeks and verified against Madeline's results

New additions to data frame
  Figure code for each figure. This will be linked to a Google drive folder with the image for easy access. The link to the google folder where the screenshot is     stored will be an entry in the disease data table.
  Add column for sample size n.
  
The focus moving forward for data collection is on susceptible oysters. Papers with resistant strains can be potentially revisited later. 

All google folders involved in the data collection will be linked to the README.md disease_data page in github.

Flowchart for approved papers & figures:
Confirm use of a Figure in study → Take a screenshot of the figure, add to Google Drive → Extract data from Figure → Compare to Eric’s data → Clean and format data in spreadsheet → Label paper as complete

Eliminate Ford 1987 (Pub Code: 1987_Ford_TJoP) from the disease data collection. Eric had extracted data but we will not use it.

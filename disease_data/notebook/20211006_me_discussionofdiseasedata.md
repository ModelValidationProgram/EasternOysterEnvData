Discussed data extraction papers (Andrews 1964, Andrews 1984, Ford 1987)
Data extracted from these three papers will be the first data entered into a new data frame created by Madeline
HS Interns will be given figures from the three papers over the next weeks and verified against Madeline's results

New additions to data frame
  Figure code for each figure. This will be linked to a Google drive folder with the image for easy re-access. The link to the screenshot will be an entry in table
  Add column for sample size n
  
The focus moving forward for data collection is on susceptible oysters. Papers with resistant strains can be potentially revisited later. 

All google folders involved in the data collection will be linked to the README.md disease_data page in github.

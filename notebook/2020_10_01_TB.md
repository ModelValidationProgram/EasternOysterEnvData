## KEL notes
- use flag-filtered
-  The only report the daily mean, daily max, and daily min. Averages are calculated accordingly.
- Add column for "frequency" of observations and range of years

**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, USGS station 8017118 is the only datasource listed for both temperature and salinity.

I'm using an updated version (data range: 1998-2020) of the file originally provided by Erin (data range: 1999-2016).

**BEST DATASETS** - these are daily max, daily min and daily mean datasets.

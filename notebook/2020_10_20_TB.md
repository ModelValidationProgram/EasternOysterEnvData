ME High and Low populations are being treated together do decide best datasources.

This map includes population locations, all the datasources listed for both temperature and salinity, and an USGS station I found nearby (temp only). All locations are labelled but population lat and long are marked as "P".

# ME_DR_HI_High_W - Temperature

**Primary**

Jose Antonio Hog Island Buoy (Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data readings once per month Jan.- Nov. 1990-2016. 
* Thais's notes (after looking at the file): Temperature in celsius. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: Hog Island, Sheepscot and Lewis. Monthly readings **but readings for several months are missing for most years; HogIsland does have a few whole years (years with data for all months**). This is the best datasouce because Hog Island is very close to the population location. Sheepscot is close enough that it could be ok for temperature, but not as good as HogIsland, and only 2 years have data for all months. Lewis is far away, towards the ocean and no whole years.

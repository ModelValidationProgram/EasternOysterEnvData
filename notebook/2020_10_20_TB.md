The first half of this file has notes on temperature and salinity datasources for both ME populations, High and Low. The datasource files for both these populations are listed several times for both populations in EasternOysterSeascape and OysterSeascape spreadsheets. So I'm listing each datasource file here separately, and going through them one by one and making notes to see what makese sense to use for each population. The map below helps to determine the proximity of the datasources to each population, High and Low.

This map includes population locations, all the datasources listed for both temperature and salinity, and an USGS station I found nearby (temp only). All locations are labelled and population lat and long are marked as "P" to make it easier to find their location relative to the datasources locations.

# ME_DR_HI_High_W - Temperature

**Primary**

Jose Antonio Hog Island Buoy (Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data readings once per month Jan.- Nov. 1990-2016. 
* Thais's notes: Temperature in celsius. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: Hog Island, Sheepscot and Lewis. **Monthly readings; but readings for several months are missing for most years; HogIsland does have 3 whole years (st 1 2002 and 2004, st 2 2004)**. This is the best datasource location-wise for the High population because Hog Island is very close to the population's location (see map). Sheepscot is close enough that it could be ok for temperature, but not as good as HogIsland (see map), and no whole years available. Lewis is far away, towards the ocean and no whole years (see map). *I'm not using Sheepscot or Lewis for temperature*.


Damian Brady Darling Marine Center (LOBO_Data_Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: LOBO data has both temperature and salinity from Upper Damariscotta from April-Nov for 2015-2019.
* Thais's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data frequencies and ranges for each year are: hourly, Sept-Nov 2015; hourly, Apr-Nov 2016; hourly, Jun-Nov 2017; hourly Apr-Nov 2018; no data for 2019. this looks like a good datasource location-wise for the High population (see map), but all years are missing several months, mostly cold months. **Might need to be compared to Hog Island data to capture colder months.**

UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt
* Erin's notes: Sensor 066 (UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt) has salinity and temp data 2015 -2019 in May-Nov. Also, hints that this file is the same as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE file.
* Thais's notes: this file has the same data as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE file **plus 2019 data: hourly, Jul-Nov 2019**. The file has also been cleaned out of other data (turbidity, nutrients, etc) so it is like a summary file. The lat/long for this location is the exact same as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE location. **I will use this instead of Mook SeaFarm to compare to Hog Island because it contains additional (2019) data.**

**Other**

Bar Harbour Bouy
* Erin's notes: Temp given in celsius. Hourly readings Jan-Dec. 2007-2019. The OysterSeascape data spreadsheet has the lat/long and is plotted on the map above. 
* Thais's notes: I think this is a high resolution dataset but it is too far away from the population (see map), so *I'm not using it*.

Upper Damariscotta LOBO (data_dock.csv) 
* Erin's notes: no notes.
* Thais's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data frequencies and ranges for each year are: daily-ish (lots of gaps); Jun-Dec 2004; Jan-Feb 2005; May-Dec 2007; Mar-Dec 2008; Jan-Feb, Sep-Dec 2009; every 3-4days Jan-Dec 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019; Jan-Nov (2013, 2014); Jan-Mar 2020. The location is about 5.7 miles (9km) downstream from the population's location (see map). I think this could be a good source of temperature data for the High population, given the data covers the winter months better than the primary datasources. No salinity though. **I will compare this with Hog Island and UpperDamariscotta_temp_sal_2015-19.txt**

~LOBO_Data_Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE.xlsx - this file is listed as primary and other, so same notes as above.~

# ME_DR_HI_High_W - Salinity

**Primary**

Upper Damariscotta LOBO buoy (LOBO Data_Mook SeaFarm_UDRE.xlsx)
* Erin's notes: LOBO data has both temperature and salinity from Upper Damariscotta from April-Nov for 2015-2019.
* Thais's notes: Salinity in psu. Data frequencies and ranges for each year are: hourly, Sept-Nov 2015; hourly, Apr-Nov 2016; hourly, Jun-Nov 2017; hourly Apr-Nov 2018; no data for 2019. This looks like a good salinity datasource for the High population location-wise (see map), but all years are missing several months, mostly cold months. **The location is close to the population's location (see map) and salinity does not seem to have a strong seasonal trend at first glance, so this could be a good salinity datasource for the High population.**

UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt
* Erin's notes: UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt has salinity and temp data 2015-2019 in May-Nov.
* Thais's notes: Salinity in PSU. This file has the same data as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE file **plus 2019 data: hourly, Jul-Nov 2019**. The file has also been cleaned out of other data (turbidity, nutrients, etc) so it is like a summary file. The lat/long for this location is the exact same as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE location (see map). **The location is close to the location of the High population and has the additional 2019 data, so I will use this instead of the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE file**


Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx
* Erin's notes: no notes.
* Thais's notes: Salinity in pct? I'm assuming they meant ppt. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: Hog Island, Sheepscot and Lewis. **Monthly readings and readings for several months are missing for most years; HogIsland does have 10 whole years (st1 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2004, st2 2002 and 2004, st3 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2004)**. This is the best salinity datasouce for the High population location-wise because Hog Island is very close to the population location (see map). Sheepscot is close enough that it could be ok for salinity, but not as good as HogIsland, and has 2 whole years (st3 2000 and 2004). Lewis is far away, towards the ocean and no whole years. *I'm not using Lewis or Sheepscot for salinity*. **I will compare salinity data from Hog Island to Upper_Damariscotta_temp_sal_chla_2015-2019 file**.

> Based on these notes: I will compare **Hog Island and UpperDamariscotta_temp_sal_2015-2019** to get salinity data for ME_DR_HI_High_W.

# ME_SR_SM_Low_W - Temperature

* Erin's note: Site is colder than Damariscotta and fresher but still salty, would have general salinity and temp meyer report. See SHEEPSCOTT TABS IN EXCEL FILE - NOTE THAT SITE IS VERY FRESH AND THE SALINITY MAY NOT BE OK
* Thais's note: I think by "site", they meant "population site", meaning the site for population ME_SR_SM_Low_W is colder and fresher but still salty in comparison to the site for population ME_DR_HI_High_W. I don't know what a general meyer report is. All primary temperature datasources for this "Low" population are the same as those listed for the "High" population - so if both populations are in sites that differ in temperature, I don't see how the same datasources can be good for both populations. In file Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx, perhaps Sheepscot will be good for the Low population, based on Erin's note above.

**Primary**

Jose Antonio Hog Island Buoy (Temp_Sal_Hog_Island_Sheepscot_Lewis_ME.xlsx), 
* Erin's notes: Temperature in celsius. Data readings once per month Jan.- Nov. 1990-2016. 
* Thais's notes: Temperature in celsius. 1990-2016. This file has data for 3 locations: Hog Island, Sheepscot and Lewis. *I will not use Hog Island and Lewis for population* Given Erin's note above that this Low population site is supposed to be colder, **I will use Sheepscot temperature data for this Low population.** **Monthly readings and readings for several months are missing for most years and Sheepscot does not have whole years. I will combine the data to get temp data for each month, even though not available for the same year**. This seems like an ok temperature datasouce location-wise for the Low population because Sheepscot is close to the population location (see map). Hog Island is good for the High population and Lewis is pretty far from both so *I'm not using Hog Island or Lewis for temperature for this Low population*.

Damian Brady Darling Marine Center LOBO_Data_Mook SeaFarm_UDRE.xlsx, 
* Erin's note: LOBO data has both temperature and salinity from Upper Damariscotta from April-Nov for 2015-2019.
* Thais's note: Again, I don't know how this can be good for both the High and Low populations at the same time, if the Low population is known to be colder. **But might compare to Sheepscot temperature to check**

UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt. 
* Erin's note: Sensor 066 (UpperDamariscotta_Temp_Sal_Chla 2015-2019.txt) has salinity and temp data 2015 -2019 in May-Nov
* Thais's note: this file has the same data as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE file **plus 2019 data: hourly, Jul-Nov 2019**. The file has also been cleaned out of other data (turbidity, nutrients, etc) so it is like a summary file. The lat/long for this location is the exact same as the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE location. Again, I don't know how this can be good for both the High and Low populations at the same time, if the Low population is known to be colder. **But might use this istead of the Mook_SeaFarm_UDRE to compare to Sheepscot temperature to check**.

USGS station - USGS 01038000 Sheepscot River at North Whitefield, Maine
* Thais's notes: I found this USGS stations, 15 miles (24k) north/upstream of the population's location. Probably colder, so not good, but I might take a look at the data. Temperature only.

> Based on these notes: I will compare **Sheepscot, UpperDamariscotta_temp_sal_2015-19, dockdata and the USGS station** to get temperature data for ME_SR_SM_Low_W.

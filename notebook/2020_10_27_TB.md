# Map of populations (marked with a P) and datasource locations:

https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1paClfxbz7rbNH6Dyh37e8K_XS2DTiXeY&usp=sharing

> NY locations are not defined as High, Med or Low. 

> Lat/long for location NY_LI_CM_XXX_W give a site on land.

> The same temperature and salinity primary datasources are listed for both locations, without alternative sources. 


## COMPARE SOURCES
> Temperature datasource listed for these two populations is a NOAA buoy "National data Buoy center 44040 Western Long Island Sound"; Salinity datasource listed for both populations is Save the Sound, https://www.savethesound.org/water-monitoring-ecological-health, 2018_UWS_Data.xlsx.

> That means no datasources to compare. 

# PopID: NY_LI_LH_XXX_W and NY_LI_CM_XXX_W - Temperature
* Erin's notes: NBDC buoy Historical data is available for this buoy from 2004 to 2019. Includes temperature but not salinity. Data is from Jan-Dec.
* Thais's notes: NBDC files only show temperature data for years 2004 and 2005. Other data available 2006-19, but not temperature (nor salinity). Confirmed by checking the source website. 2004 is missing Oct9-Dec14; 2005 is missing Nov10-Dec31 **Should I look for a new location to replace this? (ask Katie)**

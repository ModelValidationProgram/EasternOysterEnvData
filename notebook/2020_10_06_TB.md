**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, USGS station 07381349 is the only datasource listed for both temperature and salinity.

I'm using an updated version (data range: 1997-2020) of the file originally provided by Erin (data range: 2002-2016).

**BEST DATASETS** - these are daily max, daily min and daily mean datasets.

**Flag-filtered** - For USGS datasets: "Data-value qualification codes included in this output: ***  Value unavailable; A  Approved for publication -- Processing and review completed; P  Provisional data subject to revision (from provider)". *"Flag-filtered column" has data flagged "A" only (F and *** excluded).*

**Whole-yrs only** - original range: 1997-2020; years excluded 1997, 2000, 2001, 2017, 2020 (based on data map below).

**Plot showing data distribution by year and month - the numbers inside the boxes are the number of datapoints per month in each year; full datasets = 31 (for months with 31d), 30 (for months with 30d), 29 or 28 (for February, leap and reg years)** This is to see if there's any 'wholes' in the dataset (missing too many winters or summers, etc) that could bias the calculated means in the table above. - this is more relevant for temperature than for salinity, but I plotted for both.

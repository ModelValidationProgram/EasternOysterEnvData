**COMPARE SOURCES**

> No sources to compare, the files inside of a folder named NOAA_8536110_Cape_May_NJ are the only datasource found for both temperature and salinity. One of the spreadsheets mentions a second source "Rutgers data: https://hsrl.rutgers.edu/HSRL%20documents/Water%20Temperature/index.temperature.html" but Erin's note says Rutgers sites need to be investigated for proximity to the oyster site (Check with Katie).

Erin's note says: "data in 15 min increments" but data are in hourly increments (see plot below showing datapoints per month in each year).
Data range temperature: 1997-2020, but missing 2015 and patch in some years.
Data range conductivity (salinity): 2019-2020


**BEST DATASETS** - these are hourly readings (i.e., up to 24 readings per day).

## PopID: NJ_DB_CS_Med_W Temperature - filtration steps to clean dataset

> There was no data quality control in this file; units not provided in Erin's files but I went to the source and downloaded the data again, with units.
> Temperature in Celsius and conductivity in mS/cm; I converted conductivity into salinity using http://salinometry.com/pss-78/

Plot showing data distribution by year and month - the numbers inside the boxes are the number of datapoints per month in each year, at an hourly resolution. Full datasets = 744 (for months with 31d x 24h), 720 (for months with 30d x 24h), 696 or 672 (for February, leap 29d x 24h; and reg years 28d x 24h). This is to see if there are any 'holes' in the dataset (missing too many winters or summers, etc) that could bias the calculated means in the table below - this bias would be more relevant for temperature than for salinity, given the seasonality of temperature.

# PopID: NY_LI_LH_High_W

## Map:

Lat/long for this population - unclear whether exact or approximate; Erin's note says "farmer collected samples". 

Lat/long for datasources are exact.

## Summary notes:

**Environmental data for this population are exactly the same as for population NY_LI_LH_High_W; so summary notes are the same.**

Temp: datasource is NOAA "National data Buoy center 44040 Western Long Island Sound";
- temperature data available hourly for years 2004 and 2005 (confirmed by checking the source website); 
- 2004 is missing Oct9-Dec14; 
- 2005 is missing Nov10-Dec31.

Sal: data source is "Save the Sound" https://www.savethesound.org/water-monitoring-ecological-health 2018_UWS_Data.xlsx; I believe they requested the datafile over email because I don't see a place to download data on the website. Data available May-Oct 2018, two readings per month.

Our meeting notes are confusing me re salinity - it says to label this site as "High" but also that we did not trust the salinity data and should call it NA. I did both but seems contradictory now, **ask Katie**.

## Datasources and filenames:

**Environmental data for this population are exactly the same as for population NY_LI_LH_High_W; so datasource, content of datafiles and plots below are the same.**

Website: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=44040 (temp only); NA for salinity.

Temp: NY_LI_LH_High_W.xlsx

Sal: NA

## Plots: all data over time and data availability per month per year (this helps visualize the 'missing winter' question and other gaps in data) (simple plots made in excel).

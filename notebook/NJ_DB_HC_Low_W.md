# PopID: NJ_DB_HC_Low_W

## Map:

Unclear from Erin's notes if lat/long for population are exact or approximate as there are no notes.

Lat/long for NOAA datasource (Ship J Shoal) are exact; lat/long for URI data not available.


## Summary notes:

- Temp: I compared primary source (URI) with Ship J Shoal (cleaned up a bit, see notes on 2020-10-29 entry) (see KEL and TB notes from meeting on 2020-10-29) and combined them in the Summary table presented below.

- Sal: from the 2020-10-29 meeting notes, I understood we should use the salinity calculated from conductivity data from the primary source (URI) - this is what is presented in the Summary table below. Let me know if I misunderstood the meeting notes, and if I was supposed to compare/combine salinity URI with salinity Ship J Shoal instead.

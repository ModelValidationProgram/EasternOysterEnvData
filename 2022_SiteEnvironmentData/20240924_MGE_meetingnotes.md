# Meeting with Nicole about environmental data for exp sites + seascape sites
- We both used the same R template that Madeline developed for collecting the environmental data from online sources
- Nicole made an environmental distance matrix with the data

Nicole's sites and the seascape overlap
- ME Hog Island (ME2 is the closest site)
- NH Great Bay (NH1)
- FL Atlantic Coast (FL3)
- LA Sister Lake (LA4)
- TX Capano Bay (TX2)
- VA James River Deep Water Shoal (VA1)
- DEBY ()
- LOLA (has ~May 2023 - May 2024 salinity and temperature for Coan River, VA)* short-term high resolution with seasonality

Seascape environmental data inclusion protocol (M.G.E.)
- 10_years_recent
- 6_months_data (captures seasonality)
- 1_daily_measure (1 data point per day)
- 3_years_data total

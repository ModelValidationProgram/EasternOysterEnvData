# Meeting with Nicole about environmental data for exp sites + seascape sites
- We both used the same R template that Madeline developed for collecting the environmental data from online sources
- Nicole made an environmental distance matrix with the data

Nicole's sites and the seascape overlap
- ME Hog Island (ME2 is the closest site)
- NH Great Bay (NH1)
- FL Atlantic Coast (FL3)
- LA Sister Lake (LA4)
- TX Capano Bay (TX2)
- VA James River Deep Water Shoal (VA1)
- DEBY (passes QC)
- LOLA (has ~ May 2023 - May 2024 salinity and temperature for Coan River, VA)* passes QC as a short-term high resolution site that captures seasonality

Seascape environmental data inclusion protocol (M.G.E.)
- 10_years_recent
- 6_months_data (captures seasonality)
- 1_daily_measure (1 data point per day)
- 3_years_data total

OR 

- long-term low resolution
- short-term high resolution with captured seasonality

## Sites in common between the two studies that pass QC where we are using the same data from seascape samples - check to make sure our data is the same for the sites that we have in common
- NH1, passes check
- ME2, passes check
- FL3, passes check
- LA4, passes check
- TX2, passes check

## Sites in common that are borderline QC
- VA2: doesn't pass QC based on 6 months of seasonal data, we don't have any data outside of May - October and don't see range in low temps that we might expect

## Conclusions
- We have the same data for the sites listed above and the selection line data passed QC
- Nicole + Madelin ewill run analyses with VA2 for now, we can check in to see how that site looks and if it's wonky we may have to remove it
